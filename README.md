------
Like Racoon and Kangaroo, here comes the Cow detector using Faster RCNN.

# Model
Download the model from here - [Link](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md#coco-trained-models-coco-models) 

##### And also included my inference graph for testing purpose - [Link](https://github.com/niyazed/cow_detection/tree/master/inference_graph)
