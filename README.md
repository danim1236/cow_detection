Like Racoon and Kangaroo, here comes the Cow detector using Faster RCNN.

# Model
Download the model from here - [http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28.tar.gz](http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28.tar.gz) 

##### And also included my inference graph for testing purpose - [Link](https://github.com/niyazed/cow_detection/tree/master/inference_graph)
